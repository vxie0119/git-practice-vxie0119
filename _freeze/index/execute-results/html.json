This cooperative approach to education was\nfacilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages\ncollaborative coding and content development.\n\n\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests\nto our dedicated GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the\ncourse material but also provided students with practical experience\nin collaborative software development and version control. To view\nthese contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please\nvisit our Spring 2024 repository at <https://github.com/statds/ids-s24>.\n\n\nFor those interested in exploring the lecture notes from the previous\nyears, the [Spring 2023](https://github.com/statds/ids-s23) and\n[Spring 2024](https://github.com/statds/ids-s22)\nare both publicly accessible. These archives offer\nvaluable insights into the evolution of the course content and the\ndifferent perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.\n\n## Midterm Project\n\nOur mid-term project on rat sightings in New York City is to be\nshowcased in a virtual session at the NYC Open Data Week, 2024, the\nweek following the Spring Break. Four students will be selected to\npresent topics on the mid-term project.\n\n## Final Project\n\nStudents are encouraged to start designing their final projects from\nthe beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be\nused. Here is a list of data challenges that you may find useful:\n\n+ [ASA Data Challenge Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home)\n+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)\n+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)\n+ [Top 10 Data Science Competitions in\n  2024](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/data-science-competitions)\n\nIf you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a\nposter to [UConn Sports Analytics Symposium\n(UCSAS) 2024](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2024/).\n\n\n## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\n\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a\ncritical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this\ninsightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:\n\n> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,\n> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of\n> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown\n> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online\n> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a\n> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found\n> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is\n> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible\n> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you\n> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our\nstudents: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast\nresources available to solve complex problems in data science.\n\n## Wishlist\n\nThis is a wish list from all members of the class (alphabetical\norder, last name first, comma, then first name).\nAdd yours through a pull request; note the syntax of nested list in\nMarkdown.\n\n+ Last, First\n    - Wish 1\n    - Wish 2\n+ Yan, Jun\n    - Make data science more accessible to undergraduates\n    - Co-develop a Quarto book in collaboration with the students\n    - Train students to participate real data science competitions\n\n\n### Presentation Orders\n\nThe topic presentation order is set up in class.\n\n::: {#466a883e .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npresenters = [\"Doe, John\",\n              \"Doe, Jane\",\n              \"Smith, Alan\",\n              \"Harris, Joe\"]\n\nimport random\nrandom.seed(71323498112697523) # jointly set by the class on 01/30/2023\nrandom.sample(presenters, len(presenters))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n['Doe, John', 'Harris, Joe', 'Doe, Jane', 'Smith, Alan']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Course Logistics\n\n### Presentation Task Board\n\nHere are some example tasks:\n\n+ Data science ethics\n+ Data science communication skills\n+ Import/Export data\n+ Descriptive statistics\n+ Statistical hypothesis tests `scypy.stats`\n+ Model formulas with `patsy`\n+ Statistical models with `statsmodels`\n+ Data visualization with `matplotlib`\n+ Grammer of graphics for python `plotnine`\n+ Handling spatial data with `geopandas`\n+ Visualize spatial data in a Google map with `gmplot`\n+ Random forest\n+ Naive Bayes\n+ Bagging vs boosting\n+ Neural networks\n+ Deep learning\n+ TensorFlow\n+ Autoencoders\n+ Reinforcement learning\n+ Calling C/C++ from Python\n+ Calling R from Python and vice versa\n+ Developing a Python package\n\n\nPlease use the following table to sign up.\n\n   Date  | Presenter              | Topic\n  ------ | ---------------------- | ------\n  02/06  | Cheu, Catherine        | Visualization with `matplotlib`\n  02/08  | Ho, Garrick            | Pandas part 1\n  02/13  | Mastrorilli, Ginamarie | Pandas part 2\n  02/13  | Yi, Guanghong          | Grammer of graphics for python `plotnine`\n  02/15  | Karandikar, Shivaram   | Text processing with `nltk`\n  02/20  | Chua, Yang Kang        | Support Vector Machine with `scikit-learn`\n  02/20  | Jones, Courtney        | Descriptive Statistics\n  02/22  | Sullivan, Colin        | Statistical hypothesis tests scypy.stats\n  02/27  | Shen, Tong             | Decision tree with `scikit-learn`\n  03/01  | Bedard, Kaitlyn        | Handling spatial data with `geopandas`\n  03/06  | Nhan, Nathan           | Bagging vs boosting\n  03/08  | Parchekani, Kian       | Naive Bayes\n  03/20  | Noel, Luke             | Plotting on maps with `gmplot`\n  03/20  | Whitney, William       | Autoencoder\n  03/27  | Nguyen, Christine      | Calling R from Python and vice versa\n  03/27  | Cummins, Patrick       | K-means clustering\n  03/29  | Zheng, Michael         | Web Scraping with `Selenium`\n  04/03  | Lunetta, Giovanni      | Softmax Regression & Neural Networks with `TensorFlow`\n\n### Final Project Presentation Schedule\n\nWe use the same order as the topic presentation for undergraduate\nfinal presentation.\n\n   Date  | Presenter\n  ------ | ---------------------- \n  04/10  | \n  04/15  | \n  04/17  | \n  04/22  | \n  04/24  |\n\n\n\n### Contributing to the Class Notes\n\nContribution to the class notes is through a `pull request'.\n\n+ Start a new branch and switch to the new branch.\n+ On the new branch, add a qmd file for your presentation\n+ Edit `_quarto.yml` add a line for your qmd file to include it in the notes.\n+ Work on your qmd file, test with `quarto render`.\n+ When satisfied, commit and make a pull request.\n\nI have added a template file `mysection.qmd` and a new line to `_quarto.yml`\nas an example.\n\nFor more detailed style guidance, please see my notes on [statistical\nwrirting](https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/using-the-right-tools-for-writing.html#latex-for-typesetting).\n\n\nPlagiarism is to be prevented. Remember that these class notes are publicly\navailable online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on []how to\navoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). \nIn particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use\nour own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the\ncode chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.\n\n\n### Homework Requirements\n\n+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See @sec-git.\n    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).\n\t- Never \"Upload\" your files; use the git command lines.\n\t- Make commit message informative (think about the readers).\n+ Use `quarto` source only. See @sec-quarto.\n+ For the conveinence of greading, add your html output to a release in your\n  repo.\n\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Data analysis\n\n+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively\n+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing\n+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later\n+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators\n\n### Presentation\n\n+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator\n+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code\n+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize\n\n\n<!-- Topic presentation template -->\n## My Presentation Topic (Template)\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nPut an overview here. Use Markdown syntax.\n\n\n### Sub Topic 1\n\nPut materials on topic 1 here\n\nPython examples can be put into `python` code chunks:\n\n::: {#10ca5365 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# do something\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Sub Topic 2\n\nPut materials on topic 2 here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPut sumaries here.\n\n",
